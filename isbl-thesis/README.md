# @isbl/thesis

This folder contains source code for PDF-rendering engine. It is not a part of the thesis. It is in the same repository only because I want to be able to make change as needed.

## Building

To build this package you need to have `yarn`. Then you can install dependencies by running `yarn` and to build it you can run `yarn vite build`.
