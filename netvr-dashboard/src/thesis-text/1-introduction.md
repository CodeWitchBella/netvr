# Introduction

Virtual Reality (VR) technology progressed considerably since the days of first head-mounted displays (HMDs):cite[sword-of-damocles], but implementing good same-room multi-user experiences:footnote[Users being in same physical space as opposed to connected online.] is still not very well documented.

## Goals {#goals}

The goal of the semester project is to explore available options for tracking multiple VR users in shared physical space. Another goal is to choose and implement at least one of the methods. Subsequently I aim to find and learn a procedure which can be used to evaluate the implemented method.

Full multi-user experience consists of multiple parts most of which are the same regardless of the experience being in shared space or not. Therefore, I had to implement complete multiplayer VR application, because to be able to fully evaluate the implemented method I need full control over many underlying systems. This should serve as a good base for further experimentation and improvements.

The main overarching goal is to prepare for the thesis, where I want to provide concrete guidance and tips should the reader want to implement such experience themselves.

## Thesis Structure {#thesis-structure}

This thesis will be split to multiple chapters describing the steps needed to implement such application. First I will analyse requirements and constraints - both from the assignment of this thesis and from resources available to me while writing this thesis.
